# Data-Driven Documents

**D3.js** is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. **D3** helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
